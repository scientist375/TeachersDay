TeachersDay
===========

My first repository - Code for a simple LCD with arduino to display text for teachers day.
Liquid crystal Library created by David Mellis, Limor Fried and Tom Igoe.
Source code and algorithm written by Angad Daryani ( www.angadmakes.com ) on 4/9/2014 @ 23:10hrs.
Uses 16,2 character LCD yellow light display with arduino uno 328 and 10k potentiometer.
Each row can accomodate only 16 characters. Even a space is a character. The LCD has 2 rows.
The for loop runs 100 times. We only required it to run 3 times.100 is for convenience of shooting video.
